Interactive Formatter
---------------------

* Read IRB source for how to drop into a session with code executed
* Add diagnostics to Assertions/Suites: line of definition (e.g. via caller).
  That way the code piece that failed could be displayed (trimmed and unindented
  text between line of definition of the current assertion and line of
  definition of closest assertion/suite/eof)
